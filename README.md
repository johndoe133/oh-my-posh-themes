# oh-my-posh-themes
An extension of the emodipt theme which adds the python virtual environment to the prompt. Due to color clashing between the official python yellow colors and the github yellow, and between the official python blue and the path blue, I have made the path to a lavender. 

## How to use
Add this to your ~/.bashrc file:

```
eval "$(/home/ekj/.local/bin/oh-my-posh --init --shell bash --config 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johndoe133/oh-my-posh-themes/refs/heads/main/python-emodipt-extend.omp.json')"
```
